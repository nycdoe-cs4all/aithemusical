### Acknowledgements

This unit was developed by NYC Public Schools CS4All's [<mark style="color:green;">**Kelly Johnston**</mark>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kellymariejohnston1/)**.**&#x20;

### Overview

This unit is aligned to both the [NYS Next Generation ELA standards](http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/new-york-state-next-generation-english-language-arts-learning-standards) and the [NYS Computer Science and Digital Fluency standards](http://www.nysed.gov/curriculum-instruction/computer-science-and-digital-fluency-learning-standards). Because our classrooms are made up of students with a broad continuum of learning needs, this unit was built using the [UDL approach](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11cKbdXj2oqm56OsLpOVbsF\_W5n5o8YFKGH6WhBplKjI/edit) and affords students multiple modes of representation, engagement, and expression. It is also guided by Nonie Lesaux's and Emily Phillips Galloway's research focused on [Advanced Literacies for Academic Success](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/nov-8-nys\_brief-1-of-8\_summer\_2017\_adv\_lit\_final\_2.pdf-a.pdf), and aligns to all four of the Literacy Hallmarks:&#x20;

* [**Hallmark 1**](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/nov-8-nys\_brief-3-of-8\_summer\_2017\_hallmark\_1final\_2.pdf-a.pdf): Work with engaging texts that feature big ideas and rich content.
* [**Hallmark 2**](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/nov-8-nys\_brief-4-of-8\_summer\_2017\_hallmark\_2-final\_2.pdf-a.pdf)**:** Discuss to build both conversational and academic language and knowledge.
* [**Hallmark 3**](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/nov-8-nys\_brief-5-of-8\_summer\_2017\_hallmark\_3\_final\_2.pdf-a.pdf)**:** Write to build language and knowledge.
* [**Hallmark 4**](http://www.nysed.gov/common/nysed/files/nov-8-nys\_brief-6-of-8\_-summer-2017\_-hallmark-4-vocab\_final\_2.pdf-a.pdf): Study a small set of high-utility vocabulary words and academic language structures to build breadth and depth of knowledge.

### Nota Bene

You know your students best and while every effort is being made to provide you with abundant resources for this unit, you will invariably encounter students who need something different, require a different pace, etc.&#x20;

**NOTE ABOUT VOCABULARY**:&#x20;

### NYS Next Generation ELA Standards

* **SL1**: Initiate and participate effectively in a range of collaborative discussions with diverse partners on complex topics, texts, and issues; express ideas clearly and persuasively, and build on those of others.
* **W1c:** Use precise language and content-specific vocabulary to express the appropriate complexity of the topic.

### NYS Computer Science & Digital Fluency Standards

* **9-12.IC.1** Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.
* **9-12.IC.3** Debate issues of ethics related to real world computing technologies.
* **9-12.IC.5**  Describe ways that complex computer systems can be designed for inclusivity and to mitigate unintended consequences.
* **9-12.CT.10:** Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

### **Suggested Duration**

The pacing of this unit will depend largely on instructional choices you make and the needs of your students. There are sufficient materials and activities for five full instructional days of rigorous intellectual engagement. Each of the lessons is intended for a 45-minute class but can be stretched or condensed according to your setting. Depending on your setting, your students' needs, and any revisions you make to the curriculum, the end of unit project--if completed in class--will require at least two days.&#x20;

### Pre-requisites

There are no pre-requisites for this course! It is designed for high school students.&#x20;

### Overview of Instructional Materials

This unit is entirely unplugged with the option of inviting students to use digital platform(s) for the end-of-unit task. Importantly, the lessons leading up to the end-of-unit task are intentionally unplugged with the exception of the teachers' slide deck projected for mini-lessons.

You will need to provide the following materials for this lesson sequence:

* [Sentence strips](https://www.amazon.com/sentence-strips-teachers/s?k=sentence+strips+for+teachers) (5-8 per student)
* Blank chart paper (6-8 per class for lesson sequence and more if students opt to use chart paper for their end-of-unit presentations)
* Markers
* [Skeins of yarn](https://www.michaels.com/search?q=cotton%20yarn) (determine quantity by reading the directions for lesson three and considering the size of the particular skeins you are looking at!)
* Slide decks for each lesson (not provided in this repository)
* All other resources are linked in the unit

### Learning Sequence&#x20;

* Lesson 1: Crowdsource an Epic Playlist
* Lesson 2: Design a Content Filter
* Lesson 3: Make Predictions with Our Content Filter
* Lesson 4: Design a Collaborative Filter & Cluster
* End of Unit Project: Design a Music App
