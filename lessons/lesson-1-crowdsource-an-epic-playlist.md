### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, students will generate their own data for a days-long experience in using data to train an algorithm. First, students will acquire a collective understanding of what Spotify is and that it has a ‚Äòplaylist‚Äô feature that automates recommendations. Students will then work in pairs or small groups to generate lists of their favorite songs, which they will write on sentence strips. (Each sentence strip will hold one song title). The lesson wraps up with an application of Kapor‚Äôs Component 5 to critically analyze the data collection process.  \[[Source](https://kaporfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Responsible-AI-Guide-Kapor-Foundation.pdf)]



### Nota Bene

The activity in this lesson is designed to save you preparation time by having students write the names of the songs they come up with on sentence strips. These sentence strips will be used in lesson 2.

### Objectives

Students will be able to...

* engage in collaborative discussion with peers  about a specific topic;
* generate data points based on their musical preferences;&#x20;

### Suggested duration

45 minutes (adjust according to your students' needs)

### NYS Next Generation ELA Standards

* **SL1**: Initiate and participate effectively in a range of collaborative discussions with diverse partners on complex topics, texts, and issues; express ideas clearly and persuasively, and build on those of others.
* **W1c:** Use precise language and content-specific vocabulary to express the appropriate complexity of the topic.

### NYS Computer Science & Digital Fluency Standards

* **9-12.IC.3** Debate issues of ethics related to real world computing technologies.
* **9-12.IC.1** Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

### Vocabulary

* <mark style="color:purple;">**recommendation system**</mark>: a recommendation system (or recommender system) is a class of machine learning that uses data to help predict, narrow down, and find what people are looking for among an exponentially growing number of options. ([source](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/glossary/recommendation-system/))
* <mark style="color:purple;">**generate**</mark>: to produce or create something
* <mark style="color:purple;">**bias**</mark>: an interest in one thing more than others
* <mark style="color:purple;">**mitigate**</mark>: to make something less harmful

### Hook

Give students time to think, write, and talk with a partner about the following prompts:&#x20;

* What are some of your favorite songs?&#x20;
* How did you discover these songs?
* How do you find new music?

Facilitate a class-wide discussion by asking students to share what they discussed with their partner. It is likely that students will mention Soundcloud, Youtube, Spotify, TikTok or another source for finding new music. Use this connection as a way to transition to the mini-lesson.

### Mini Lesson&#x20;

If students did not mention Spotify as a source to find new music, you might ask ‚ÄúHow about Spotify?‚Äù It‚Äôs possible that only a handful of students use Spotify.\* Use your judgment to decide how you will give some basic information about the app. Here are some possibilities:&#x20;

* invite one or two students who use the app to explain briefly why they use it and some key features;&#x20;
* if you have your own Spotify account and feel comfortable doing so, you might project it onto the SmartBoard and give a quick tour‚Äìbeing sure to highlight Spotify-generated playlists;
* show this short promotional video, [What is Spotify](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8L5ySUufdE\&ab\_channel=SpotifyCares), and do tell students it‚Äôs a Spotify ad!
* Once students understand that the Spotify app automatically generates playlists for listeners, ask students: How do you think Spotify generates playlists for specific listeners?
* Project slide that defines artificial intelligence as a term that generally refers to data-trained algorithms that do some kind of automation. Present different examples of automation performed by different models and ask students which of these models might be one used by Spotify. Let students know that as a class, we are going to go through an unplugged simulation of the process for training a recommendation algorithm to create our own music app that generates playlists.
* Let students know that our first step will be to generate the data we will use to train the algorithm, and that we will do that by working in small groups to talk about our favorite music!

### Activity

Strategically group students in pairs or groups of no more than four. Give each group markers and sentence strips. Ideally, each student will generate a list of 3-5 musicians. Push each group to have at least 3 songs per person with no doubles. So, for example, if everyone loves a specific Dua Lipa track, only one person can put that song on a sentence strip. This will ensure that you have enough data to work with in the following lessons.&#x20;

Students work in their groups to generate a list of songs they enjoy‚Äìeach student must come up with 3 to 5 different songs and write each of their names on a sentence strip.

Depending on your personal tolerance for spirited group work‚Ä¶you might encourage singing. üôÇ

Circulate as students are generating their lists of songs and take note of any difficulties they are having. For example, are some groups struggling to identify 3-5 unique choices per person because there is so much overlap in their preferences?&#x20;

### Wrap Up&#x20;

Check in with students and elicit some feedback from them about how this activity went. In particular, ask about overlapping preferences.

Let students know that you will be collecting all their sentence strips and that we will use them in tomorrow‚Äôs lesson.

Kapor Framework Component 5 questions concerning data:

* Is our dataset biased? Are you sure?
* How can biases in datasets cause harm to individuals or groups? What artists might be privilege by this data set? What artists might be harmed?
* What actions might we take in our data collection process to try and reduce or eliminate potential biases?
