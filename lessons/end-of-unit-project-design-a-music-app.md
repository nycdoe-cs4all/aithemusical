# ðŸŽ¼ End of Unit Project: Design a Music App

### Project Overview

The end of unit project is a GRASP task (see Jay McTighe's and Grant Wiggins' [GRASP template](https://jaymctighe.com/downloads/GRASPS-Design-sheets.pdf); see also [Revisiting GRASP: A model for project-based learning](http://www.aidan-hammond.net/new-blog/tag/GRASPS)). The following scenario sets the stage for students to demonstrate their learning. <mark style="color:purple;">Students are invited to choose from a menu of options as the format for their final project. Each option comes with instructions, requirements, and a rubric.</mark>

### GRASP Task



**GOAL**: The goal is to design a music streaming app that solves two problems stakeholders find with other apps: new artists are disadvantaged by the recommendation algorithm and users get stuck in filter bubbles which prevent them from encountering novel content.&#x20;



**ROLE**: You are a \[choose your role!] on a team that is building a new music app.

* software engineer
* project manager
* product designer or UX/ UI designer
* marketing & communications director



**AUDIENCE**: Music lovers, content creators in your community and the venture capitalist who has provided your team with seed money.



**SITUATION**: You are part of an exciting new start-up company that just received seed funding from a venture capitalist (VC) who is a real music lover. Your funder is especially interested in your project because they care about people having access to recommendations that encourage them to move outside their comfort zone. The VC is also (secretly) a closet musician trying to break into the music scene.&#x20;



**PRODUCT**:&#x20;

* You must create a poster and presentation to be delivered to the VC funding your project. Your pitch should include the following:
  * A catchy name and logo design for your app
  * A mission statement that communicates your commitment to algorithmic transparency and why you are dedicated to making your recommendation algorithm open to auditing.
  * An explanation of how you will use content- and collaborative-filtering in your recommendation algorithm along with suggested guardrails and safeguards to prevent the following:
    * harms to new artists;
    * filter bubbles;
* Ideas for marketing your app
