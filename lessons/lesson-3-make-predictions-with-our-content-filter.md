# üîÆ Lesson 3: Make Predictions with Our Content Filter



{% hint style="info" %}
### Essential Question:

To what extent can content filters accurately predict what new things we might like?&#x20;
{% endhint %}



### Anchor Text(s) for this Lesson

* Slide deck
* Student generated data set (sentence strips with song titles)
* [How Spotify‚Äôs AI-Driven Recommendations Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGntmcy\_HX8\&ab\_channel=TheWallStreetJournal)

### Supporting Text(s)/ Resources for this Lesson

* Skein(s) of yarn&#x20;
* Chart paper at each station (with students‚Äô notes)

### Lesson Overview

In this lesson, students will engage in another kinesthetic activity that gives them an embodied experience of a content filter. Students will then view a video about Spotify‚Äôs AI-Driven recommendations and compare their own design with Spotify‚Äôs. The lesson wraps up with a return to Kapor component 6 as students engage in a conversation to brainstorm ideas to mitigate potential harms to content creators such as new artists who might be harmed by the product design. Pay particular attention to how collaborative filtering might help reduce or increase such harms.

### Nota Bene

In order to prepare for this lesson, have 3 skeins of yarn. You might want to cut long pieces of yarn in advance or do so in the midst of the activity. Each station should be set up with the chart paper produced during yesterday‚Äôs session that highlights the main category and subcategories for the songs included at each station. A piece of yarn will connect stations once they have a common quality in the subcategory. The stations with the strongest link (number of yarn pieces connecting them) will be understood to have the strongest proximity in terms of song types.



### Objectives

Students will be able to...

* evaluate data points to identify shared features;
* categorize data points (songs) into groups based on shared features;
* make predictions about what songs a particular person might like by using the unplugged content filter;
* actively listen to peers' ideas and observations and ask follow-up questions;
* communicate observations and answer peers' follow up questions;

### Suggested duration

45 minutes (adjust according to your students' needs)

### NYS Next Generation ELA Standards

* **SL1**: Initiate and participate effectively in a range of collaborative discussions with diverse partners on complex topics, texts, and issues; express ideas clearly and persuasively, and build on those of others.
* **W1c:** Use precise language and content-specific vocabulary to express the appropriate complexity of the topic.

### NYS Computer Science & Digital Fluency Standards

* **9-12.CT.10:** Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.
* **9-12.IC.5** Describe ways that complex computer systems can be designed for inclusivity and to mitigate unintended consequences.
* **9-12.IC.3** Debate issues of ethics related to real world computing technologies.
* **9-12.IC.1** Evaluate the impact of computing technologies on equity, access, and influence in a global society.

### Vocabulary

* <mark style="color:purple;">**content filter**</mark>: uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback ([source](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/content-based/basics))
* <mark style="color:purple;">**category**</mark>: a group of people or things with particular features in common
* <mark style="color:purple;">**assumption**</mark>: a belief or feeling that something is true or that something will happen, although there is no proof
* <mark style="color:purple;">**similarity**</mark> (<mark style="color:green;">similarities</mark>): being like someone or something but not exactly the same
* <mark style="color:purple;">**outlier**</mark>: a person or thing that is different from or in a position away from others in the group; a data point on a [graph](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/us/definition/english/graph) or in a set of results that is very much bigger or smaller than the next nearest data point
* <mark style="color:purple;">**audit**</mark>: an official examination of the quality or standard of something

### Hook

Give students time to think, write, and talk with a partner about the following prompts:&#x20;

* Share your three favorite songs (right now) with your partner.&#x20;
* When you think about your 3 favorite songs, what do they all have in common?&#x20;
* Do you think you will always and forever prefer music that has these shared qualities? Explain your reasoning.
* Make sure both partners have a chance to share!

### Mini Lesson&#x20;

Provide students with instructions for the activity that will make concrete the threads connecting different songs in their database.&#x20;

Be sure to present norms and expectations based on your understanding of your particular class.&#x20;

Keep this super short because after the activity you will bring the class back together to screen and discuss the video [How Spotify‚Äôs AI-Driven Recommendations Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGntmcy\_HX8\&ab\_channel=TheWallStreetJournal).

### Activity

Start with one student from one station sharing with the group a song in their collection and some subcategories describing its qualities. Any other groups with a song that shares one or more of those qualities will say ‚Äúconnection!‚Äù and then a thread will be given to connect those collections. If station 1 presents a song that has qualities found in songs included in station 5, students will be given a piece of thread to hold connecting their stations.

Go to the next station and ask a student to present one of their songs, and repeat the process above.&#x20;

Once there are at least ten connections between stations, start facilitating a conversation about patterns that are emerging; what are some possible limitations? What happens if a brand new artist drops some content on Spotify? \[You might want to get some pictures of your visualized content filtering system!]

Screen the video [How Spotify‚Äôs AI-Driven Recommendations Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGntmcy\_HX8\&ab\_channel=TheWallStreetJournal) with the following ‚Äòpurpose for viewing question‚Äô: <mark style="color:yellow;">**What does our algorithm share in common with Spotify‚Äôs? What‚Äôs different?**</mark>

### Wrap Up&#x20;

Check in with students and elicit connections between their yarn connecting experience (representing a content filter) and the collaborative filters mentioned by Spotify.

Engage students in conversation with these prompts (or your own as you facilitate):

* Can we add and integrate ten new songs into our system? What would we need to do to give those new songs the same treatment the songs already in the system were given?
* To what extent can we as humans identify all the possible patterns or shared characteristics across songs?&#x20;
* What if we add a million more songs? What if we use ‚Äòuser preference data' to identify those features or characteristics (like danceability, includes synthesizer claps, brass section in a specific key, and so on!)?
* \[Here is where you highlight for students the usefulness of data-driven automation. Point back to the part of the video that mentions ‚Äòlatent features']
